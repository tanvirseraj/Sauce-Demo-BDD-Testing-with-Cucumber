# Cucumber
Cucumber is a testing framework that uses Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) to support collaboration, discovery, and examples. BDD is a way for software teams to work that closes the gap between technical and business people by reducing communication. Cucumber's BDD approach allows developers and customers to specify behaviors to test, such as incorrect or correct logins.
